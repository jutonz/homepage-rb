## Description

Create thorough test coverage for fraction functionality including unit tests for utilities, model tests for integration, and system tests for end-to-end workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests cover fraction parsing edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Unit tests cover fraction display formatting variations
- [ ] Model tests verify fraction storage and retrieval
- [ ] Integration tests verify form submission with fractions
- [ ] System tests verify complete user workflow for adding fractional ingredients
- [ ] All tests maintain backward compatibility with existing decimal quantities
