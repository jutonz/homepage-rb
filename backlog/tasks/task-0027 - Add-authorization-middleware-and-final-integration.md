## Description

Implement policy verification middleware to ensure all controllers properly authorize actions, and create comprehensive integration tests to verify the complete Pundit authorization system works correctly across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All controllers properly authorize actions or explicitly skip authorization
- [ ] Middleware provides helpful error messages for missing authorization
- [ ] Integration tests cover authorization across all major application flows
- [ ] System handles authorization failures gracefully in both web and API contexts
- [ ] Authorization system is fully functional and secure across the entire application
