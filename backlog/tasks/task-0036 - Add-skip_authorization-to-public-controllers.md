## Description

Properly configure public controllers (SessionsController HomesController CallbackController) to explicitly skip authorization verification since they handle public access and authentication flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SessionsController includes skip_after_action :verify_authorized
- [ ] HomesController includes skip_after_action :verify_authorized
- [ ] CallbackController includes skip_after_action :verify_authorized
- [ ] Skip configurations include clear comments explaining why authorization is skipped
- [ ] Controllers maintain existing functionality without authorization interference
