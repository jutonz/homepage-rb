## Description

Allow grouping ingredients for recipes, if desired. A group is optional. For example, if I have a recipe for muffins, I might want to group the ingredients into wet and dry ingredients. On the recipe show page, grouped ingredients must appear together, though the ordering of the groups and the items within the groups should be customizable.
